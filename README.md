## Usage

## Developmen

### Poetry
Poetry is a really nice python dependency manager. It lets you keep track of versions and easily update, unlike pip. 
You can get it with `pip install poetry` then set up by running `poetry install` from within the directory. It will create a virtual environment and install consistent versions of things.

### SeQUeNCe (Not used)
You can see the repo here: https://github.com/sequence-toolbox/SeQUeNCe The bit we'd have to update is `src/entanglement_management/generation.py` and it's dependencies. There are usage examples but they're not very well documented.
